# Hand-Gesture-Mouse-Control
Control your mouse using hand gestures with Python, OpenCV and MediaPipe

This is a Python-based computer vision project that allows you to control your mouse cursor using hand gestures captured via webcam. Built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and pynput, this virtual mouse system detects hand landmarks in real-time to move the cursor and perform left click using simple finger gesture (pinch).
